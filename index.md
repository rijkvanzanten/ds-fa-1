# ds-fa-1
The first final assignment for the data structures class

## Notes

I tried using serverless functions. However, serverless functions are supposed to be stateless, making database connection pooling basically impossible. (There are workarounds, but those defeat the purpose).

I haven't really figured out what the perfect usecase for serverless functions would be. I'm guessing it would be a good "middleman" solution to other third party services maybe?
